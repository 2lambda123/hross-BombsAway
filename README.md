A screen scraper for tracking the score of Super Bomberman 2 games on Super Nintendo

This is a simple project that uses DirectShow and a TVTuner to watch the output from a super nintendo console (using a coax splitter) to keep track of super bomberman scores based on what happens on the screen.

The major drawback right now is it has some hard coded colors and screen sizes.
